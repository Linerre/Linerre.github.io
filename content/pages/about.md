# About me
I'm Zhiren Lin. When studying in Australia, Aussies tend to call me **Ziren** and some of my friends/mates prefer just **Lin**. On the Internet I often use **errenil**, pronounced as "error nil".

I'm mostly interested in the following subjects:
- GNU/Linux (Arch, Gentoo, NixOS)
- Emacs (along with some editor-specific things)
- Programming Languages and Compilers
- Blockchain and decentralized Web3 applications
- Web technologies (Deno, Node.js, TypeScript, etc)
- Free and Open Source Software (FOSS)
- Skateboard (out of practice for too long, alas)
- Learning Japanese/Korea and improving English
- Reading long in-depth reports published on *The New Yorker*
- (Some) K-Drama TV series

# About this site
Previously the site was built with [Hakyll](https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/), but after my old domain expired, I planed to migrate my site to a new domain with a new SSG.  Now it runs on [Lume](https://lume.land/). As the migration is in process, expect more.
